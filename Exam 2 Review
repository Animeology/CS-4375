	- Linear Regression: Predict an continuous value
	- Logistic Regression: Predict an category/Discrete value
	- Cross Validation: To see which one is the better model
	- Decision Tree: One tree per section
	- Random Forest: Many decision tree broken up into several sections
	- Scalar: scales the test model to be equal, don't use it on decision trees
	- SVM (Support Vector Machine): boundary line that divide different data sets
    - PCA (Principle Component Attribure): get rid of attributes that don't contribute as much to the dataset, only usage
